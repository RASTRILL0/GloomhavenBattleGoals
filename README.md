# GloomhavenBattleGoals

Hi, I put together a small application that secretly assigns battle goals to players for my group to use while we remote play during this pandemic. I figured I might as well share it with the community too.

Try the tool here: http://ghbg.duckdns.org/

Just enter some number in the seed box and make sure the rest of your group is using the same number. Select your player number and press draw to have two cards assigned to you. The tool won’t assign the same cards to a different player. It works on mobile or desktop and you can include Satire’s Extended Battle Goals in the draw by checking the box.
